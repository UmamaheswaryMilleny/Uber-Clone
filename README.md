  - "Drive when you want, make what you need"
  - "The Uber you know, reimagined for business"
  - "Make money by renting out your car"
- **App Download Area**: Features QR code sections and app store links.
- **Comprehensive Footer**: Contains grouped links, social media icons, and location settings.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive states for buttons, links, and navigation items.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic structuring of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and responsiveness.
- **SVG & Images**: Used for icons and feature graphics.
